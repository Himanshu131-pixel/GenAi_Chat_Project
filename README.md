# GenAi_Chat_Project
This Python script builds a conversational AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The assistant is designed to simulate structured reasoning by following a strict sequence of cognitive steps: "analyse", "think", "output", "validate", and "result" â€” all returned in a well-defined JSON format.
